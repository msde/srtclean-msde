# srtclean-msde
A Visual Studio 2005 project that cleans up live closed captioning recorded by an old Hauppage card for use as .SRT subtitles.

Live closed captioning tends to be entered in one character at a time as it is heard, resulting in lag, and a large number of deltas that can be combined into a single, complete message.
