180
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,233
TO THINK THEY EVEN HAVE A CHANCE

181
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,300

182
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,167

190
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,133
MAN.

191
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

192
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,833
I SAID, "I JUST WANT TO CATCH

193
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,766
THAT FIRST BALL AND RUN RIGHT

194

00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,534
JUST TEACH THEM WHAT IT TAKES

199
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,000
TO BE A PRO FOR REAL.

200
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,833

LA PLATA, MARYLAND.

221
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:21,800
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PRO.

222
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,967
ANYBODY YOU CAN THINK OF,

223
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:23,800
I COULD COMPETE WITH THEM

224

OLD AGE AND 3 OF THOSE SUPER

311
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,933

00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,500
THAT IS A GO ROUTE

316
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,800
AND THAT IS SEPARATION

317
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,833

McKEEVER TRIPPING OVER HIS FEET.

340
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,334
IRVIN INTO THE END ZONE.

341
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,200
OH, AND THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN,

342
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
BUT McKEEVER WITH A LATE HIT

343
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,434
ON THE PLAYMAKER!

344
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,267
>> TOUCHDOWN.

345
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,434
>> AND MICHAEL IRVIN IS TAUNTING

346
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:18,600
AARON McKEEVER.

347
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,434
THAT IS REALLY RUBBING IT IN!

348
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,167
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AGAIN.

349
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,400
IRVIN MAKES A GREAT MOVE IN

350
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,434
THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, CUTS

351
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,300
BACK, THEN HEADED FOR THE PYLON.

352
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,733
HE TAUNTS McKEEVER, WHO TAKES

353
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,434
HIM DOWN WITH A LATE HIT.

354
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:32,133
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS AT THE ONE.

355
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,133
>> I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO GO

356
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:33,967
IN THE END ZONE.

357
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:34,800
I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN THERE

358
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,633
ALREADY.

359
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:36,500
I JUST PUT THE BALL IN

360
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,467
LIKE THIS.

361
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,500
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

362
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,133
I SPENT HALF OF MY LIFE

363
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,167
IN THE END ZONE.

364
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,067
I THOUGHT JUST TO GIVE THE BALL

365
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,100
A TRIP.

366
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,167
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO.

367
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,700

GOT THE HAMMIES STRAPPED UP

393
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,490
LIKE A POP WARNER PLAYER.

394

AARON'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD,

460
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,690
EXCEPT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S

461

>> NEXT UP, JAY McKEOWN.

479
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,123
HE'S IN THE LEAD WITH ONE STOP

480
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,424
AND HE CAN WIN THE MATCH-UP WITH

481
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,057
ANOTHER STOP RIGHT HERE, AND IT

482
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:17,290
LOOKS LIKE THE PROS ARE CALLING

483
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,324
A TIME-OUT.

484
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,623

"THE FEED YOU TECHNIQUE."

486
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,390
I'M GONNA CATCH IT, STOP SHORT,

487
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,923
BUT I'M GONNA HAND HIM BACK THAT

488
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,290
BALL AND SAY, "COME AND GET IT."

489
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,524
I'M GONNA FEED IT TO HIM.

490
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,357
>> LET'S TAKE IT TO HIM THEN.

491
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:28,390

00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:55,524
AND THAT BALL IS INCOMPLETE.

506

OOH, ANOTHER ARM BAR

755
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,957

RANDY COULD SNAP THAT ARM

00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:42,990
IN HALF AT ANY MOMENT.

765

WE'RE IN MATCH-UP TWO,

771
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,470
WHERE RANDY COUTURE ALREADY GOT

772
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,636
AARON McKEEVER TO TAP OUT

773
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:54,803
7 TIMES.

JAY McKEOWN'S LIFE, TOO.

777
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,803
HE'S TAPPED OUT TWICE, AND WE'RE

778
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:03,070
ONLY ONE MINUTE IN.

779
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,970
RANDY'S GOT HIM DOWN.

780
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,403
JAY IS A CLOSE-COMBAT INSTRUCTOR

781
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:10,304
FOR THE U.S. ARMY RESERVE.

782
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:11,536
AND IF HE GETS OUT OF THIS,

783
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:12,403
THEN HE'S REALLY DOING

784
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,337
SOMETHING.

785
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:14,170

789
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:17,470
HIS HANDS.

790
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,536
HE'S GOT A LITTLE EXPERIENCE.

791
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:19,970
>> RANDY'S TWISTING THAT FOOT,

792
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,970
AND JAY JUMPS LOOSE.

793
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,104
WHAT A MOVE!

794
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,870
OH, RANDY'S REELING HIM BACK IN.

795

796
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:27,104
IT'S A DIFFERENT BALL GAME NOW,

797
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,137
BABY.

798
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,170
>> AND RANDY RETALIATES WITH

799

A CHOKE.

>> THERE'S THE TAP.

801
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,370
THAT'S 3 TAPS FOR JAY McKEOWN.

802
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,337
>> SURE TIRING, AIN'T IT?

803
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:34,470
IT'S TIRING.

804
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,536

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,770
THE TAP.

818
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,937
THAT IS 4 TAPS FOR JAY McKEOWN.

819
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:53,970
JAY'S GOT A LOT OF TATTOOS

820
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,003
ON HIM; I HOPE HE'S GOT

821
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,170
HIS MEDICAL INFORMATION TATTOOED

822

ON HIM, TOO.

823
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,270
RANDY TAKES HIM DOWN AGAIN.

OH, BUT LOOK AT THAT!

825
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,636
JAY GETS HIM IN THE HEAD LOCK.

826
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,436
A JOE WITH THE OFFENSIVE MOVE.

827
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,470
IMPRESSIVE!

828
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,737
OH, BUT RANDY REVERSES IT,

829
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,470
GOES BACK TO PUNISHING JAY!

830
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,137
THERE GOES HIS MOUTHPIECE.

831
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,770
OH, HE'S FALLING APART IN THERE!

832
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,137
>> STOP RIGHT THERE.

CAN ONLY TAP OUT ONE MORE TIME

842
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,603

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,603
ONE MORE TIME.

849
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:33,337
COME ON.

850
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,137

FOR ALL THE JOES.

853
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:37,137
HE'S GOT HIM IN A HEAD LOCK

854
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:39,636
THERE, TURNING IT AROUND ON HIM.

855
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,937
>> START COUNTING SOME SHEEP.

856
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,070
>> TAP HIM OFF.

857
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,270
YOU'RE GONNA TAP OUT.

>> OH, HE BREAKS THE HOLD!

861
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,470
WHAT A MOVE!

862
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,803
TEN SECONDS LEFT.

863
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:51,370
HANG IN THERE, JAY.

864
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,204
COUTURE WANTS ONE MORE TAP.

865
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:56,403
>> COME ON, JAY.

866
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,603
>> JAY REFUSES TO TAP OUT.

867
00:19:58,603 --> 00:19:59,770
HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB, MAN.

868
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,770
[BELL RINGS]

869
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,636
AND THAT'S THE BELL.

870
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:02,870
JAY McKEOWN FINISHES

871
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,170
WITH 5 TAPS AND TAKES THE LEAD.

872
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,570
IT'S CLEAR THAT HIS ARMY

873
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,603
TRAINING HELPED.

874
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:08,636
>> WHOO!

875
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,037
THAT WAS CRAZY.

876
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,536
>> McKEOWN FOUGHT HIS ASS OFF

877
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,204
AND EVEN WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE

878
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:14,570
AGAINST RANDY COUTURE.

879
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,636
THIS IS ONE JOE WHO WAS NOT

880
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,803
AFRAID.

881
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:18,636
>> YOU WERE DOING A GOOD JOB

882
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:19,503
OF JUST HOLDING ONTO AN ARM

883
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,304
FOR CONTROL.

884
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,137
>> YEAH.

885
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:21,970
I'M ACTUALLY A CLOSE-COMBAT

886
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,737
INSTRUCTOR IN THE ARMY.

887
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:23,603
BUT I KNOW ANYTHING I TRIED

888
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,603
TO DO WOULD MAKE IT WORSE.

889
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:25,436
>> YEAH.

890
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:26,304
PLUS, AS YOU'RE GETTING OLDER,

891
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:27,170
IT'S TOUGH TO GET HIM OFF YOU.

892
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,970
I WORK OUT WITH HIM ALL

893
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,770
THE TIME.

894
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,003
>> HE GOT ALONG.

895
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:30,970
HE GOT SOME FREQUENT FLYER

896
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,803
MILES, THOUGH.

897
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:32,670
>> YEAH.

898
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,470
>> HE GOT UP AND DOWN.

899
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,204
>> I LIKE THAT:

900
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:34,937
"THEY HAVE A LITTLE FREQUENT

901
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:35,737
FLYER MILES."

902
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:36,636
RANDY, YOU GOT [INDISTINCT].

903
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,470
I LIKE THAT [INDISTINCT].

904
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,970

LET'S GET IT ON!

916
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,737
STARING AT A DOUGHNUT.

917
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,237
>> GET HIM, RANDY!

918
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,670
>> DAWAN'S MOVING AROUND.

919
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,703
DAWAN'S GOT ENERGY, BUT THAT

920
00:20:58,703 --> 00:20:59,803
ENERGY GOES QUICK.

921
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:02,070
DAWAN OWENS IS A STAND-UP COMIC

922
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,937
AND A JOCULAR GUY, BUT NOT

00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:15,603
WHOEVER LOSES IS GOING HOME.

1016
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,403
>> OH, I'M SPENT!

1017
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:18,636
>> WHOO!

1018
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:19,470
>> IS YOUR NECK LIKE--MY NECK

1019
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,270
IS LIKE--

1020
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,104
>> OH, MAN.

1021
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:21,903
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE WORST

1022
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:22,803
THING FOR ME WAS: WHEN HE DID

1023
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,737
THE GUILLOTINE, JUST--

1024
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,270
>> NO, I DON'T WANT TO FEEL IT.

1025
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,636
>> WHEN HE GOT YOUR HAND

1026
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,037
LIKE THIS AND LEANED BACK?

1027
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:28,937
>> YEAH.

1028
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:29,803
>> MAN, TALKING ABOUT SOME

1029
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,137
INTENSE PAIN ON THE NECK.

1030
00:23:31,137 --> 00:23:32,104
MY NECK RIGHT NOW FEELS LIKE IT

1031
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,570
JUST GOT STRETCHED OUT AND PUT

1032
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,536
BACK, AND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

1033
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:36,570
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S PAIN?

1034
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,270
THE ARM BAR ON MY ELBOW, AND I

1035
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,670
FELT IT STARTING TO CRACK, AND

1036
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,903
I'M, LIKE, TAP.

1037
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:42,436
>> YEAH, THIS DUDE POPPED TWICE.

1038
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:43,803
>> POP, POP?

1039
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:44,837
>> THAT WAS HIS SHOULDER.

1040
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:45,737
>> THAT WAS YOUR SHOULDER

1041
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:46,470
POPPING?

1042
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,270
>> MY SHOULDER, YEAH.

1043
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,803
>> THE REALITY IS, I'M NOT EVEN

1044
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,070
REALLY KNOWN AS A SUBMISSION

1045
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,104
GUY.

1046
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:53,237
I MEAN, I'M A GOOD WRESTLER--

1047
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:54,370
>> WELL, I'M BETTING YOU ARE

1048
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,304
NOW, FOR SURE.

1049
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:56,237
>> ON THE GROUND, I WAS MORE

1050
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,603
A BROWN-AND-POUND GUY.

1051
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,503
I WOULD JUST HIT YOU IN THE HEAD

1052
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,370
TILL THE REFEREE STOPPED

1053
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,170
THE FIGHT.

1054
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,636
I ONLY HAD, IN ALL MY FIGHTS,

1055
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,670
YOU KNOW, TWO SUBMISSIONS

1056
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,204
IN 22 FIGHTS.

1057
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:08,104
>> YOU MADE JOSE'S JOB VERY--

1058
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:09,137
>> YEAH.

1059
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,470
>> IT WAS ALREADY EASY, BUT YOU

1060
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,503
MADE IT MORE EASY.

1061
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:12,403
>> THEY GOT TO GO SWING A BAT

1062
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,204
NOW?

1063
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,137
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

1064
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:15,104
>> WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR IS

1065
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,304
A DIFFERENT SOUND COMING OFF

1066
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:19,304
OF MY BAT THAN THEIR BAT.

1067
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,503
>> OH, YES!

1068
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,003
>> JOES, READY FOR YOUR FINAL

1069
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:28,837
MATCH-UP?

1070
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:29,803
>> OH, YEAH.

1071
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,970
>> SO IT ALL COMES DOWN

1072
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,070
TO THIS FOR DAWAN OWENS

1073
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,137
AND AARON McKEEVER.

1074
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,337
WHOEVER WINS HERE GOES

1075
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:36,070
TO OVERTIME WITH JAY McKEOWN.

1076
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,770
THE OTHER IS HEADED HOME.

1077
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,737
STRAIGHT UP, FOR MATCH-UP 3,

1078
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:40,970
YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING ON JOSE

1079
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,170
CANSECO IN A HOME-RUN DERBY.

1080
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,703
YOU GET 5 OUTS.

1081
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:46,937
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A HOME RUN

1082
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:47,970
IS AN OUT.

1083
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,470
NOW, IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT

1084
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,870
FROM A NORMAL HOME-RUN DERBY

1085
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,837
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU

1086
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,436
EXTRA RUNS FOR DISTANCE.

1087
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:54,470
IF YOU GET IT OVER THE FIRST

1088
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,603
FENCE, THAT'S ONE RUN;

1089
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,137
SECOND FENCE, TWO RUNS;

00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:59,237
THIRD FENCE, 3 RUNS;

1091
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:01,770
FOURTH FENCE, 4 RUNS.

1092
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,003
WHOEVER CAN COME CLOSEST TO

1093
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,470
JOSE CANSECO'S SCORE OUT HERE

>> AND THAT IS A WELL-HIT BALL.

1099
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:14,436
THAT ONE'S GOING WAY OVER

1100
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:15,370
THE FOURTH WALL.

1101
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,870
>> YES, SIR, YES, SIR.

1102
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,003
>> THAT IS WORTH 4 RUNS,

1103
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,304
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

1104
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:21,803
NO PUN INTENDED.

1105
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:22,837
>> YEAH, THAT'S GONE, TOO.

1106
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:23,770
THAT'S GONE.

1107
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,703

FOR JOSE CANSECO.

1109
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,037
THAT IS A TOTAL OF 8.

1110
